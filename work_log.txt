WORK LOG for IISc Internship

13th June:
	#Lean about facial feature extraction using dlib in Python 
	#Mail ma'am regarding the status and work distribution od our internship

14th June:
	#Implemented a basic lip mask using dlib 

15th June:
	#Mailed ma'am regarding status and work distribution
	#Trying to use an auto-encoder for feature detection
	#Bugs remaining : Auto encoder isn't giving desired output
	#Added a graphical module to visualize x and y cordinates over a normalized time frame

16th June:
	#Tried to new method to extract features using fourier transforms
	#Transforms giving high DC value, uncomment the last part of the code and notice deltas at 0
	#This implies that the lips movement have very low frequency attached to it
	#Would be hard for classical algorithms to capture feautures
